Hi! I am Chenyue Jiao, a Ph.D. student in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). My advisor is [Dr. Peter Darch](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/peter-darch). I obtained my Master's degree in Archival Science from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and Bachelor's degree in Archival Science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/index.htm).

## Research Interests
As a doctoral student in Information Science, my research interests lie in scientific practices and policies related to research data curation. My research is to understand how research data is managed, discovered, understood, and used to advance science and human knowledge. The ambition is to use my expertise and enthusiasm to inform open data initiatives, as well as the development of methods, services, and infrastructures for data curation. In my previous studies, I focused on facilitating data sharing and reuse by exploring and improving current practices and policies on data publishing. Also, I dedicated to understanding disciplinary variations regarding research data practices.
