Hi! I am Chenyue Jiao, a Ph.D. student in the [School of Information Sciences](https://ischool.illinois.edu) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu). My advisor is [Dr. Peter Darch](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/peter-darch). I obtained my Master's degree in Archival Science from [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en) and Bachelor's degree in Archival Science from [Jilin University](https://global.jlu.edu.cn/index.htm).

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in **scientific practices and policies related to research data curation**. My research is to understand how research data is managed, discovered, understood, and used to advance science and human knowledge. In my previous studies, I focused on facilitating data sharing and reuse by exploring and improving current practices and policies on data publishing. Also, I dedicated to understanding disciplinary variations regarding research data practices.
